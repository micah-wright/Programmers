# Programmers
 Hi we are the programmers! We consist of Simon McNutt, Micah Wright, Arian Zhan, Elaine Nelson, and Alex Keck. This is the master branch. Upload any code here. Other files will go to certain branches. If you have questions ask Simon... or even better you could ask Phong. Phong loves talking with everyone. He is one of the most social guys on the team. He also loves to sing and dance on the side. He hopes one day to be a pro dancer whatever that is.
